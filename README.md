# Haptitune
Haptitune a Haptic Texture Designer, a tool for engineers, industrial product designers, homebrew engineers, and makers.This utility is intended to allow owners of NanoFOC Devkit (and its clones)  to easily tune HaptiCore type devices without the need for constant code downloads into the device.The application is designed to work on any operating system  (Windows, Linux, OS X, iOS, and Android via Flutter) that supports USB Serial or Serial over Bluetooth.  The tool is aimed at Novice and Advanced users who can alter Hapticore's electro-mechanical characteristics and settings.  Any user can adjust the device's basic and complex parameters and observe instant program propagation on the device while previewing the current state of position in the LivePreview window. The RTMV panel can also be used to preview (or conceivably design) a linear tactile response, or the Serial Command Interface to communicate directly with the Microcontroller and Driver  without the need for an external IDE or Serial Monitoring tools.
